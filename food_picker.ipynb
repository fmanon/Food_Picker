    "While not bad for a first (or second) attempt, there is one big flaw in the food picker - user usablility.  The user has to provide a list places to choose from, which is very inconvenient and not user-friendly.  A solution to that would be to incorporate somthing along the lines of Google Maps.  That way, the picker can use the user's location to automatically populate a list of locations to randomly select from.   The addition of somthing along the lines of Google Maps also removes bias, as we can truely randomly select locations and not rely on the user for preferences.\n",

    "Another issue would be with the count.  If we were to have a list of 25 locations, and user inputs 3 as the goal to achieve, we could, theoretically, reach a conclusion before we've made it through the list.  We would have to account for the size of the list of the selections to choose from."
